# Cryomech_PT420_Data
This repository holds the PT420 data used for analysis in the paper Tsan et. al: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011227521000813, and data from 2 more sets of PTC. Their nomenclatures are as followed:
- PT420-1: the one in the paper.
- SAT1 PTC: the one that is currently in the Simons Observatory first 90/150 GHz small aperture telescope (SAT-MF1).
- PT420-4: A spare PTC.

All PTCs are sourced from Cryomech under the same pulse tube and compressor types: PT420-RM and CPA1114 compressor. They have the same mechanical customization as mentioned in the paper. SAT-1 PTC tests were done with its own unit of pulse tube and compressor, which has a manufacture-certified performance at 50 Hz and 260 psi static pressure of 50 W at 45 K and 1.80 W at 4.2 K. For the PT420-4's setup, its own pulse tube was connected to PT420-1's compressor. Cryomech tested the PT420-4 and certified it (in its own pulse tube and compressor unit) at 60 Hz and 220 psi instead. The specs at this setting are the same as those of SAT-1 PTC. 

For more information on all the PTCs see my dissertation (TBD).
